# File Scanner

This will allow you to scan directories of files and hopefully identify JAV videos by their IDs

Goals:
* ID JAV videos
* Download metadata (from where?)
* Identify duplicate files/movies and allow you to clean them
* track ratings/favorites/tags
* manage your library/consolidate files, etc.
* view your movies/create playlists

In the end, I expect/would like this to be three things:

1. A utility that runs on your computer and tracks your files (Maybe with a utility that watches a directory and auto adds files?)
2. A website that allows you to browse your collection (with the option to run this publicly)
